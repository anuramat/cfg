# clone this repo, create dev folder
cd && git clone https://github.com/anuramat/cfg && cd cfg

## Potential problems

- If developer stuff appears in your spotlight:
```sh
mkdir /Applications/Xcode.app
# uncheck the "developer" checkbox in prefs/spotlight
rm -r /Applications/Xcode.app
```

- If for some reason rosetta doesn't get installed:
```sh
/usr/sbin/softwareupdate --install-rosetta --agree-to-license
```

- Haskell doesn't like Apple silicon, use x86 Homebrew -> x86 ghcup
