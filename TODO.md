- add fish locale to setup/config?
- verify mac defaults command for locale
- condarc and conda init in bashscript
- make utils more posix (lastarg, for loop)
- dump script for brewfile (merge?)
- master/slave file to not mess up brewfile
```bash
  cat /dev/urandom | LC_ALL=C tr -dc 'a-zA-Z0-9' | fold -w 50 | head -n 1

  conda config --set auto_activate_base false`
```

# nvim 

## problems:
- ignore <Plug> keymaps in telescope?

## editor stuff:
- harpoon?
- loclist, quickfix
- ufo for folds
- trouble vs bqf vs telescope vs lspsaga? too much overlap

## ide stuff:
- cmp hotkeys and behaviour
- dap
- neotest
- go specific
- refactorings primeagen?
