- add fish locale to setup/config?
- verify mac defaults command for locale
- condarc and conda init in bashscript
- make utils more posix (lastarg, for loop)
- dump script for brewfile (merge?)
- master/slave file to not mess up brewfile
```bash
  cat /dev/urandom | LC_ALL=C tr -dc 'a-zA-Z0-9' | fold -w 50 | head -n 1

  conda config --set auto_activate_base false`
```

nvim:
- harpoon?
- ufo for folds
- dap
- fix treesitter on buffer delete or close
- ignore <Plug> keymaps in telescope?
- loclist, quickfix usage
- lspsaga and friends https://dev.neovim.pro/lspsaga/
- refactorings primeagen?
- trouble vs bqf vs telescope? too much overlap

nvim base:
- lspsaga
- cmp hotkeys and behaviour
