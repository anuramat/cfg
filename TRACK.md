# Possible changes
- null-ls
    - is currently getting abandoned
- migrate: fzf -> skim
    - less popular
        - kubectx/kubens depend on fzf
        - not sure if mappings are the same
        - fzf is better maintained
    - still worth having because of the interactive mode
- keep fish and bash in sync
